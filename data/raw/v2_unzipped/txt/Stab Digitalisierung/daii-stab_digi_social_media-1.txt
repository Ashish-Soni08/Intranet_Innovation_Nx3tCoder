Title: II/Staffel 01 - Policy for Protecting Privacy on Social Media

Author: Anonymus

Issue Date: 10/01/2021
Effective Date: 01/11/2021

Preamble:
Communication through social media platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, is becoming increasingly important for the fictional city of Musterstadt. However, in order to protect both its employees and the city administration, certain rules and regulations must be put in place. This is especially crucial as employees are using social networks more and more in their free time, where the lines between private and professional content can often blur.

These guidelines serve as a roadmap for web 2.0 communication.

Web 2.0 and Social Media:
The term "Web 2.0" refers to a new form of the internet where users actively shape the content and appearance. The addition of "2.0" is a nod to the naming of software versions, where a new version indicates significant changes. Applied to the internet, the term implies a drastic change in the way we use it. "Social media" encompasses the platforms and networks that allow for social interaction online, where individuals communicate their experiences, opinions, images, and videos and rate each other's content. This includes blogs, wikis, social platforms, chats, and forums, such as fakebook, Twiddle, YouGone, Flicker, MySpace, and Xena. In general, guestbooks or comment sections on websites also fall under the category of social media.

General Guidelines:
1. Goals of Social Media Activities in Musterstadt: 
The city of Musterstadt is active on various web 2.0 platforms, such as fakebook, Twiddle, YouGone, Flicker, MySpace, and Xena. The following goals are being pursued:
a. Spreading city information as widely as possible 
b. Targeted marketing for different user structures on each platform 
c. Presenting Musterstadt as a modern and dialogue-oriented administration, where moods and opinions can be captured through web 2.0 platforms 
d. Creating more proximity to citizens through the use of appropriate language and quick response times 
e. Strengthening e-government activities by linking to the official website 
f. Disseminating "low-threshold" news that may not be suitable for traditional press releases
g. Taking advantage of the high level of current information and fast dissemination of the web 2.0 platforms 
h. Using different platforms as an important source of information for their work.

2. Who is Responsible for Managing Social Media Activities in Musterstadt? 
All activities on web 2.0 platforms are centrally initiated, managed, and monitored by the press department and the internet team in FD 3.5. The responsibilities are based on the "Policy for press and public relations of Musterstadt's city administration". The press department and internet team also coordinate feedback from departments and institutions in response to comments or posts on social media platforms.

3. Are Employees or Departments/Educational Facilities Allowed to be Active Themselves? 
The various web 2.0 options offer new possibilities in communication, presentation, and information. It is possible that there may be professional reasons for individual employees or institutions to be active on the web 2.0 platform. For example, participating in forums related to their profession, using social media as a source for specific professional information, or networking with like-minded individuals. In such cases, the press department or the internet team should be contacted and the following questions should be addressed:
a. Is there a legitimate reason for individual activity on a social media platform? 
b. Have the right platforms been selected? Are there alternatives? 
c. How are responsibilities governed? 
d. Has the time commitment been adequately assessed and sanctioned? 
e. Are all technical requirements in place, or does the IuK department need to step in? 
f. Is there a need for training in using the specific platform? This includes technical capabilities as well as legal and behavioral considerations (netiquette).
g. How can individual and central activities be coordinated? Important information should not be withheld from the main platforms or the official website.  
h. Are the rules of corporate identity being followed (e.g. logos)? Is it appropriate to use a personal image (portrait)? The press department and internet team are happy to provide advice in these matters.

Basic Guidelines for Private and Professional Social Media Activities:
4. Separation of Private and Professional Activities: 
Employees of Musterstadt's administration also use web 2.0 platforms for private purposes. It is important to note that even in these private activities, they may be seen as city employees. In other words, they are viewed as representatives of the city administration - whether intentionally or unintentionally - when they engage in social media activities. To protect both themselves and the city, employees should make it clear when they are acting as private individuals. This can be achieved by including a note in the imprint of personal blogs or in the profile descriptions of their social media accounts. However, it should be noted that their statements can still be seen as representing the city of Musterstadt. To maintain authenticity, employees should also use their full name, position, and department if the content is related to their work for the city administration. Pseudonyms should not be used. The official email address should only be used for professional matters.

5. Responsibility for Publishing: 
Individuals are solely responsible for any opinions they publish. Every contribution on the web 2.0 platform can be read by city leaders, colleagues, business partners, citizens, or journalists, both now and in the future. Therefore, individuals should be aware of the potential reactions and consequences of their posts. Disclaimer statements in blog imprints or profile descriptions can help protect against such reactions.

6. Timely and Appropriate Response to Third-Party Posts: 
Users of web 2.0 platforms are accustomed to timely and appropriate reactions to direct questions, comments, or criticism. Responses to relevant reader comments and constructive feedback should be polite and objective. Communication should be both competent and in a language that resonates with citizens. Humor can also be used where appropriate. However, the target audience and tone of the ongoing discussion on the platform should be taken into consideration.

7. Transparently Deal with Mistakes: 
Mistakes happen. If an error is made in a post, it should not be silently changed or deleted. Instead, the error should be publicly acknowledged and addressed constructively. Admitting to a mistake can be more effective than trying to cover it up. If previous posts are changed, it is highly recommended to document and track these changes. In critical situations, original content should be saved to facilitate tracing changes.

8. Legal Considerations: 
User rights, as well as the rights of third parties (particularly copyright and privacy laws), should be respected. Confidential information should also not be shared. When operating web 2.0 platforms (e.g. blogs or forums), freedom of expression should be considered. Any complaints should be dealt with cautiously. Deletion of a problematic comment should only occur if there is a legal violation, a breach of terms of use, or a violation of netiquette. In cases of doubt, contact the press department or internet team for guidance.

9. Social Media Activities During Working Hours: 
Private activities on web 2.0 platforms are not permitted during working hours. When working on city-related tasks, a time frame should be set. Despite the fast-paced nature of social media, employees are expected to complete tasks within normal working hours.

10. Effective Date: 
This policy takes effect immediately.
