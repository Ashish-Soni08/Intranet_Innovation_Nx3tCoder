of the Commercial Enterprise-like Institution Education in the City of Dornheim 
as of 06/08/2020 
1. Scope 
The guideline applies to the Commercial Enterprise-like Institution Education in the city of Dornheim, hereinafter referred to as "Commercial Institution Education, CIE". 
2. Basis 
The CIE is a commercial enterprise-like institution and is therefore a special asset of the city of Dornheim. The CIE currently operates in the areas of Music (with business lines Dornheim Music School, Concerts and Jeki), Grafschafter Museum, Adult Education Center (with business lines Twin Cities Partnership and Cafe Education Center) and Library (with business line City Archive). 
The accounting of the CIE is managed according to the principles of double-entry bookkeeping in compliance with commercial law principles. The business transactions are processed separately, i.e. independently from the financial accounting of the city, according to§ 94 (6) Gemeindeordnung (GO). This processing must comply with the regulations of the GO, Gemeindehaushaltsverordnung (GemHVO), and Eigenbetriebsverordnung (EigVO) unless there are other legal regulations. 
The number of checking accounts maintained by the CIE is determined by a decision of the management. This information can be found in the current version of the organizational manual. 
3. Tasks and Organization
