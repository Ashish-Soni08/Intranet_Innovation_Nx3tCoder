In accordance with §§ 70 and 72 Abs. 4 Nr. 1 of the State Personal Representation Law for the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (LPVG NW), the fictional town of "Musterstadt" - represented by the mayor - and the Staff Council - represented by the chairperson - have agreed to the following work agreement:

Work Time Arrangements for Citizen Services

Introduction:
This work agreement aims to provide a customer-oriented citizen service while also allowing employees of the Citizen Services Department to have a say in their own work schedules. This will contribute to a better work-life balance and the compatibility of work, leisure, and family.

1. Scope:
This agreement applies to employees of department FG 4.2.1, who regularly work in the open-plan office of the Citizen Services Department, even if they are occasionally assigned background tasks. This agreement regulates the applicable work time model.

2. General Principles:
2.1 The weekly standard work time corresponds to the currently agreed weekly work hours for the following sectors:
- Wage earners: 36 hours
- Civil servants: 38 hours until the age of 55, 36 hours between the ages of 55 and 60, and 35 hours over the age of 60.

2.2 The weekly standard work time is normally spread over 5 days. In the week where Saturday work is required, the work time for that day is set at 3.5 hours. This does not increase the weekly work time. Generally, when an employee works on a Saturday, a full day of compensatory time off will be granted in the same or following week.

2.3 The legally prescribed breaks of 30 minutes for 6 to 9 hours of work time or 45 minutes for more than 9 hours must be observed. The maximum work time of 10 hours must be taken into account when planning individual work schedules.

2.4 When calculating and granting vacation time, a five-day work week is assumed.

3. Shift Scheduling:
3.1 Shift schedules with the required work times will be created by superiors in consultation with employees. Work times refer to the opening hours of the Citizen Services Department. Individual work time models of employees will be taken into account when creating shift schedules. If an agreement cannot be reached, the superiors will make the final decision.

3.2 The shift schedule must be created for a period of at least 4 weeks and should be communicated at least 4 weeks in advance.

3.3 Saturday shifts must be scheduled for 6 months in advance.

4. Principles for Modified Flexible Working Hours:
4.1 Employees must be present during the scheduled work times (see Section 3).

4.2 The starting time for work at the Citizen Services Department may not be before three-quarters of an hour before opening and working hours must end no later than half an hour after closing.

4.3 In order to ensure smooth workflow and planned lunch breaks, employees may take their lunch breaks between 11:30 am and 2:30 pm instead of following the regulations in the Flexible Working Hours policy.

4.4 Considering the continuous opening hours, lunch breaks must be approved beforehand and will be decided on a daily basis in mutual consent, while taking into account the need for a smooth workflow. In case of a disagreement, superiors will make the final decision.

4.5 With regard to the shift schedule, full-day compensatory time off is regularly possible. Additional compensatory time off of up to one week will be granted upon request - no reasons required - while considering work-related interests.

5. Work Time Agreement:
The remaining terms of the agreement on flexible working hours and the AIDA Work Time Tracking Device remain unchanged for employees of the Citizen Services Department.

6. Effective Date:
6.1 This work agreement "Work Time Arrangements for Citizen Services" will come into effect on 01/02/2014.

6.2 The agreement may be terminated with a notice period of 6 months. The regulations of § 70 Absatz 4 LPGV NW apply in all other cases.
