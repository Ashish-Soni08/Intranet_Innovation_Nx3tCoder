Preamble
Between the City of Waldstadt - represented by the Mayor - and the Staff Council - represented by the Chairperson - in accordance with Sections 70 and 72(4) No. 1 of the State Employees' Representation Act for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (LPVG NW) of December 3, 1974, as currently in effect, the following collective agreement is concluded in addition to the existing "Collective Agreement on Flexitime" of June 16, 2010.

Scope
This regulation applies to employees of the central field service (department 4.1 - order), whose job description includes the task of carrying out measures for the immigration authority, such as deportations or embassy apprehensions. The collective agreement applies to deportations, embassy apprehensions, and similar measures (referrals - prison, presentations - court, or transfers - deportations by land), hereinafter referred to as "measures." These regulations do not apply if the measure ends during regular working hours or if the prescribed rest period of 11 hours can be met on the following work day within the regular working hours.

Reduction of Working Hours without Obligation for Make-Up Work for Assignments related to Deportations
If a measure is known and scheduled at least one day in advance, the following regulations apply for the work day of the measure and the following work day (Tuesday to Friday):
Work will only begin with the implementation of the measure on the day of the assignment.
If the working hours exceed midnight due to the measure, the working hours on the following day are halved; the previous rest period of 11 hours must be taken into account.
If the working hours on the day of the assignment are equal to or greater than the sum of the prescribed working hours for the assignment day and the following day, then the following work day is free from work. Any hours worked beyond this will be recorded as overtime.
Otherwise, the actual working hours on both days must not exceed the sum of the prescribed working hours for both days.
If the employee, according to clause 2.1, only starts work at the time of the planned assignment and the assignment does not take place, then the prescribed working hours are halved on this day. Clause 2.1.4 applies accordingly.
If the work assignment resulting from an unscheduled measure occurs in the morning of a work day, the prescribed working hours on the following day are halved. The rest period of 11 hours must be taken into account; clause 2.1.4 also applies accordingly.
If the work assignment resulting from an unscheduled measure occurs in the afternoon of a work day, the following applies:
The prescribed hours on the day of the assignment remain unchanged.
The following work day (Tuesday to Friday) is free from work.
If the working hours on the first day are less than 16 hours, the sum of the prescribed hours for both days can be recorded as actual working hours.

Compensation for Break Times
The prescribed reductions of hours according to clauses 2.1 to 2.4 compensate for any breaks not taken and for exceeding the maximum daily working hours during, for example, deportation actions and embassy apprehensions.

Embassy Apprehensions
If an overnight stay on site is required to comply with the regulations for the maximum daily working hours (12 hours), for example during embassy apprehensions in Berlin, then this collective agreement will not apply.

Entry into Force, Trial Phase
This collective agreement will enter into force on March 1, 2020 and will initially be valid for a trial period of one year. Prior to the end of the trial period, the department and the staff council will exchange their experiences with the aim of negotiating a continuation of the collective agreement.
