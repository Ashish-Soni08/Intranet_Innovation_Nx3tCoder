"Directive for the Use of Private Vehicles for Official Purposes
by the Employees of the City Administration of Fictionville
§ 1
General
(1) This directive applies to the use of private vehicles by the employees of the city administration of Fictionville for official purposes. It regulates the keeping of mileage logs, which serve as the basis for the payment of corresponding mileage allowances according to § 6 of the State Travel Expenses Act of North Rhine-Westphalia (LRKG NRW) for the execution of official trips (= business trips within the city limits).
(2) In case of self-caused accidents during an official trip, the costs incurred by the employees will be covered by the city of Fictionville. This also applies to any resulting increase in insurance premiums. If the self-caused accident is considered to be "gross negligence" or "intentional", the regulations in § 1 no. 2 sentence 1 and 2 do not apply.
(3) In terms of cost efficiency and taking into account ecological aspects, the primary use of public transportation or private bicycles is always to be considered. Mileage allowances according to LRKG NRW will also be paid for the use of a private bicycle.
(4) Forms and information about the responsible departments are available on the intranet under "Service & Info".
(5) Private vehicles used for official purposes must be in safe condition and undergo regular technical inspections.
§ 2
Requesting a Mileage Log
(1) The mileage logs for official vehicles and private vehicles are standardized. Therefore, to differentiate, a corresponding checkmark must be placed on the cover of the mileage log.
(2) Mileage logs for private vehicles serve as the basis for the reimbursement of mileage allowances according to LRKG NRW. A mileage log will be assigned upon request for a projected annual work-related mileage of at least 600 km (see also § 4 of this directive) or for general approvals of business trips and official errands for specific individuals or groups of people (e.g. department heads, trips to the Central IT Service Center, to branch offices of the adult education center). Trips outside of Fictionville will be settled via the request for travel expenses.
(3) The form for assigning a mileage log for the purpose of official use of private vehicles is available electronically and must be forwarded to Department 3 with the necessary information.

§ 3
Keeping the Mileage Log
(1) The mileage log must include the name of the employee, the official license plate number of the private vehicle used for official purposes (car or two-wheeled motor vehicle). The simultaneous use of other vehicles is possible. Their license plate numbers must also be entered in the mileage log. Entries for official trips must be made in the same mileage log, indicating the license plate number of the vehicle used for the trip.
(2) Changes in license plates for private vehicles used for official purposes must be immediately reported in writing to Department 3. The discontinuation of the use of a private vehicle or the use of additional vehicles for official purposes must also be reported.
(3) If trips are made outside of regular working hours or in exceptional cases during non-working times (e.g. vacation, illness, compensatory time off or overtime reduction), this must be noted in the "remarks" section and promptly signed off by the immediate supervisor.
(4) Each official trip must be duly and completely entered into the mileage log according to the given instructions and, if applicable, confirmed by those who rode along.
(5) For employees predominantly working in the field, who combine multiple official errands during a single trip, the primary location or activities carried out there must also be noted in the mileage log, in addition to the starting and ending times of the assignment.
(6) Normally, trips from home to the workplace and back (including for lunch breaks) are not considered official trips but private ones. Exceptions to this are trips outside of regular working hours (e.g. during on-call duty or emergency deployments) or outside regular working hours for the execution of enforcement actions. Other justified exceptions require the approval of the immediate supervisor on a case-by-case basis; corresponding decisions must be documented by written sign-off and date in the mileage log.
(7) Department management* ensures that spot checks of the mileage logs are carried out (verifying both the accuracy of calculations and the content - e.g. plausibility regarding the destination and reported mileage).
(8) After the final settlement of a mileage log, the mileage reading must be transferred to the new mileage log and signed off by the immediate supervisor.
(9) To have a complete record, employees must keep the mileage logs for three full calendar years after the last settlement and present them upon request. An inspection of the mileage logs in use is also possible at any time.
                                                 
* As long as there are other organizational forms within the administration, the regulations of this agreement also apply to them accordingly.

§ 4
Settlement
(1) The payment of mileage allowances is subject to a 6-month time limit. It starts on the day after the official trip ends.
(2) For official errands within Fictionville with a total mileage of up to 600 km per year (without being assigned a mileage log), the reimbursement of mileage allowances can be requested using the corresponding form.
(3) Mileage allowances for official errands settled via a mileage log must be requested using the corresponding form upon assignment of a mileage log.
(4) The above regulations do not apply to expenses for business trips, which must be claimed using the appropriate form.
(5) The aforementioned regulation does not apply to the area of "blanket approved business trips". These can also be settled based on the entries in the mileage log or by using the "Travel Expense Report" form.
§ 5
Effectiveness
This directive goes into effect immediately. It replaces the previously valid version of the Directive for the Use of Private Vehicles (3.5/05) for Official Purposes from 02/13/2015.
